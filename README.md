## Description

**Rick and Morty Universe** is a dynamic web application built with React as part of our portfolio. The project utilizes a full **CRUD** system to manage data stored on Firebase, and it initially consumes data from the Rick and Morty **API** via Postman. Users can browse a rich collection of characters from the series and even create their own unique characters. This project showcases our proficiency in API integration, CRUD operations, state management, and modern, responsive UI design.
